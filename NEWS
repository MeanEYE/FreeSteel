FreeSteel release 0.3
---------------------
* New features

- Extract personal X.509 (public) personal certificates
  Use the -q or --qualified argument to extract personal certificate for
  qualified digital signatures and -s or --standard to extract the other
  certificate stored on the smart card. You can pass the file name as the next
  argument or <JMBG>_q.cer and <JMBG>_u.cer will be used as default where
  <JMBG> is the personal number stored on the eID.

- Added --silent option that can be used with extract files options when
  filenames are specified at the command line to skip reading other data from
  the eID card.

FreeSteel release 0.2
---------------------
* New features

- Photo extraction now works
  Use the -p or --photo argument to extract the photo stored on the eID. You
  can pass the file name as the next argument or <JMBG>.jpg will be used as
  default where <JMBG> is the personal number stored on the eID.

- Place of residence address can have variable fields count
  Fields like appartment number or building floor number are optional.
  FreeSteel will not crash when reading eID without the address details.
